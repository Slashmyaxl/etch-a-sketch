# etch-a-sketch

In this project, I'll re-create a toy most of us are familiar with.

The user will be able to choose the size of the drawing grid from 16 to 100 squares, which can be changed at any time with the click of the corresponding button. The user will then be able to hover their mouse pointer over anywhere in the grid to fill in the corresponding square, the shade darkening with each following pass. There will also be an erase button.
